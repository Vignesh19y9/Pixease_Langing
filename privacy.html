    <h1>Contact</h1>
    <ul>
      When contacting us (e.g., via a contact form or email), personal data is

      exclusively for the purpose of answering your request or for contacting
      you and the associated technical administration. The legal basis for
      processing this data is our legitimate interest in answering your request

      at concluding a contract, the additional legal basis for processing is
      Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. Your data will be deleted once your request has
      been processed. This is the case if it can be inferred from the
      circumstances that the facts in question have been finally clarified and
      provided that there are no legal storage obligations to the contrary.
